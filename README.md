This is a simple Todo application built using React. 
The app allows users to create, update, delete, and filter tasks. 
Each task has a name, description, and status (either "Completed" or "Not Completed"). 
The app features a responsive UI that displays tasks in a card layout.

Features:

Create a Task: Users can add a new task with a name and description. By default, tasks are marked as "Not Completed". 
Update a Task: Users can change the status of a task between "Completed" and "Not Completed". 
Delete a Task: Users can delete a task from the list. 
Filter Tasks: Users can filter tasks by their status, showing either "All", "Completed", or "Not Completed" tasks.
